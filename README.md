# Go Connect Four: Human vs. Computer

This is a command-line version of the classic vertical boardgame in which players take turns dropping chips into columns in an attempt to form horizontal, vertical or diagonal lines of 4 or more.  It’s a human vs. computer challenge.  The computer’s decisions are governed by the negamax algorithm with optimizations that include alpha-beta pruning, move ordering and a transposition table.  On startup, the program prompts the user for the algorithm’s maximum search depth; difficulty increases with larger values.   

I wrote this program as an exercising in learning the Go programming language.  Plus, this is my first experience using GitHub.
